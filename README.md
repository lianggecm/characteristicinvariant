# Characteristic invariant
The jupyter notebook file chrcinvt.ipynb contains all codes necessary to reproduce the study published in the article "A Characteristic-based constitutive law for dispersed fibers". The notebook was created using SageMathCloud (SMC) (http://cloud.sagemath.com), which is the best place to run and modify the current code. 

To run the code on SMC, simply copy this notebook over to SMC and set the jupyter notebook kernel to SageMath.
